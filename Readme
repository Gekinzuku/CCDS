This is an updated version of our game Santa's Challenge. Unfortunately, over the years I lost the original code for SC but this is basically it.

Note: To make use of loading levels from FAT, make sure you have a way of playing homebrew DS ROMs on an actual DS and comment out the line following line in source/rooms.cpp
TempFunction(); return;

Enjoy!
